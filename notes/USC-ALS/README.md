# Algebra and Logic Seminar: Spring 2014


## Feb 7: Intuitionistic type theory and paranormal programs.

**Abstract:**

Can we write a computer program that takes as input two functions
defined on an infinite set and outputs in finite time whether or not
the functions are equal?

In this introductory lecture, I present some basic ideas of Per
Martin-L&#246;f's intuitionistic type theory with the goal convincing
members of the seminar that the question above makes sense. I will
describe Martin Escardo's "seemingly impossible" functional program
that performs an exhaustive search over the Cantor space of infinite
binary sequences in finite time. If time permits, I will present a
proof of Diaconescu's Theorem that the Axiom of Choice implies the Law
of Excluded Middle.
