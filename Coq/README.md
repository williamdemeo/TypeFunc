# Proof General on Ubuntu

## Installing Coq and the Proof General/Emacs IDE
In Ubuntu (version 13.10, and probably others) Coq and Proof General are easily
installed with the Synaptic package manager.

## Andrej Bauer's YouTube tutorials
Andrej Bauer provides a nice series of [nine short YouTube tutorials][] about using Coq.
For example, in [How to use Coq with Proof General][], he shows how to use Coq
to prove that Pierce's law is equivalent to the Law of Excluded Middle.  

The Coq programs in the directory Bauer are based on Andrej's tutorials.
